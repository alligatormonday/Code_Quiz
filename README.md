## Description

This is my submission for my fourth homework assignment for the University of Arizona - Coding Bootcamp for Full-Stack Web Development program.

View deployment here: [Code_Quiz](https://alligatormonday.github.io/Code_Quiz/index.html)

In this assignment, my goals were as follows:

* Gain a better understanding of local storage web APIs
* Create functioning JavaScript with a specific task of rendering a responsive quiz 
* Building a functioning timer
    * Responsive to user input within the quiz
* Use JS to style and/or code into the HTML to display onto the document/window

This was the most challenging homework assignment, yet. I relied on a lot of help from my cohorts in the bootcamp, as well as some other resources.

I approached this assignment by first pseudo-coding the process of what I wanted to accomplish in creating this quiz. Then I tried to break down those steps, one by one. 

Upon completing this assignment, I feel more confident about the relationship between JavaScript and HTML.
